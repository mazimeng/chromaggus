# questions
* do we do constructions?
* do we have class transformation? pointless since we don't have fixed classes.
* what do we benefit from cities?
  * gold?
  * armors and weapons?
* what do players want to spend gold on?
  * buy new weapons and armors? it can be very annoying to maintain item durability when we have lots of heroes.
  * heroes' payment
* centralized armory?
* what determines how much gold a city generates?
